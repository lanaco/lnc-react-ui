Lnc React UI Web Components provide simple and complex components and layout.

#

## Requirements

# Getting Started

---

## Add @lanaco/lnc-react-ui to an existing app

First of all dependency `@lanaco/lnc-react-ui` needs to be added to the project

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={nord}>
  {'npm install @lanaco/lnc-react-ui --save'}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

In order to use @lanaco/lnc-react-ui you have to wrap your application's root component into ThemeProvider.
You will find this component most likely in src/App.js:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="jsx" style={nord}>
  {'import { ThemeProvider } from "@lanaco/lnc-react-ui";\n...\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <ThemeProvider>\n       <MyApp />\n   </ThemeProvider>\n  );\n}'}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

# Theming

`ThemeProvider` has `theme` prop which accepts name of the theme. Available themes are `Lanaco Light` and `Lanaco Dark`.
Default value is `Lanaco Light` theme.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="jsx" style={nord}>
  {'<ThemeProvider theme={"Lanaco Light"}>\n   <MyApp />\n</ThemeProvider>'}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Custom theme can be created following the set of rules used for theme definition. 
Theme is an object where required fields are:
* name
* class
* colorContext,
* components
* palette
* sizes
* borderRadius
* boxShadow
* typography
* zIndex
