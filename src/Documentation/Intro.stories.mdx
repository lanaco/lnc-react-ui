# Getting Started

---

## Add @lnc-react-ui (kako ce se zvati vec) to an existing app

First of all dependency `@lnc-react-ui` needs to be added to the project

```
npm install @lnc-react-ui --save
```

In order to use @lnc-react-ui you have to wrap your application's root component into the ThemeProvider.
You will find this component most likely in src/App.js:

```jsx

import { ThemeProvider } from '@lnc-react-ui';
...
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemeProvider>
        <MyApp />
      </ThemeProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Theming

`ThemeProvider` has `theme` props which accepts name of the theme. Available themes are `Main` and `Main copy`. (mozda ih malo prikazat)
Default value is `Main` theme.

```jsx
<ThemeProvider theme={"Main"}>
  <MyApp />
</ThemeProvider>
```
