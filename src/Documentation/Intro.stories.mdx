# Getting Started

---

## Add @lanaco/lnc-react-ui to an existing app

First of all dependency `@lanaco/lnc-react-ui` needs to be added to the project

```
npm install @lanaco/lnc-react-ui --save
```

In order to use @lanaco/lnc-react-ui you have to wrap your application's root component into ThemeProvider.
You will find this component most likely in src/App.js:

```jsx

import { ThemeProvider } from '@lanaco/lnc-react-ui';
...
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemeProvider>
        <MyApp />
      </ThemeProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Theming

`ThemeProvider` has `theme` prop which accepts name of the theme. Available themes are `Lanaco Light` and `Lanaco Dark`.
Default value is `Lanaco Light` theme.

```jsx
<ThemeProvider theme={"Lanaco Light"}>
  <MyApp />
</ThemeProvider>
```

Custom theme can be created following the set of rules used for theme definition. 
Theme is an object where required fields are:
* name
* class
* colorContext,
* components
* palette
* sizes
* borderRadius
* boxShadow
* typography
* zIndex
